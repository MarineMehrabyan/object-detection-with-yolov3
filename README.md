_____Object Detection using YOLOv3_____

This code uses the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) model to detect objects in images. The YOLOv3 model is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that can perform object detection in real-time.

We load the pre-trained YOLOv3 model, which is stored in yolov3.weights and yolov3.cfg, because it is a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed for object detection tasks. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection model that can detect multiple objects in an image and localize them by drawing bounding boxes around them. The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of images and has learned to recognize a wide variety of objects such as cars, people, animals, and more. By using this pre-trained model, we can avoid the time-consuming process of training our own object detection model from scratch, and instead leverage the knowledge and expertise of the YOLOv3 developers.


_____Dependencies_____
This code uses the following Python libraries:

cv2: This library is used to read and display images, and perform object detection.
numpy: This is a numerical computing library.


_____Usage_____

To run this code, you need to have the following files in the same directory as the code:

yolov3.weights: This is the pre-trained weights file for the YOLOv3 model.
yolov3.cfg: This is the configuration file for the YOLOv3 model.

You can call the detect_objects() function with the path of an image as an argument to detect objects in that image. The function will display the image with the detected objects highlighted by bounding boxes and labels. It will also print the total number of objects detected in the image.

You can also call the detect_objects() function with multiple images to detect objects in all of them.
